The main window consists of four main areas: the toolbar, the viewport, the property editor and the library browser. The toolbar contains buttons for common actions such as creating, opening, saving and exporting models. The viewport shows a preview of your model and allows you to manipulate it using various tools and modes. The property editor displays the properties and parameters of your model and its components, such as branches, leaves and fronds. The library browser lets you browse and select models from the included libraries or from your own custom folders.

## How to use the interface and the basic features of SpeedTree Modeler 5.1
 
SpeedTree Modeler 5.1 is a user-friendly software that lets you create and edit realistic 3D trees and plants using various tools and modes. In this section, we will introduce you to the interface and the basic features of SpeedTree Modeler 5.1.
 
The interface of SpeedTree Modeler 5.1 consists of four main areas: the toolbar, the viewport, the property editor and the library browser.

- The toolbar contains buttons for common actions such as creating, opening, saving and exporting models. You can also access the menus, preferences, scripts and help from the toolbar.
- The viewport shows a preview of your model and allows you to manipulate it using various tools and modes. You can zoom, pan, rotate and orbit the camera using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. You can also switch between different views such as perspective, orthographic, wireframe and shaded. You can use the tools on the left side of the viewport to select, move, rotate, scale and edit your model components. You can also use the modes on the right side of the viewport to change the appearance and behavior of your model such as wind, ambient occlusion, level of detail and growth.
- The property editor displays the properties and parameters of your model and its components, such as branches, leaves and fronds. You can adjust these properties and parameters using sliders, spinners, checkboxes and color pickers. You can also use curves to control how these properties and parameters vary along the length or width of your components. You can also add forces and collisions to your model to simulate natural phenomena such as gravity, wind and pruning.
- The library browser lets you browse and select models from the included libraries or from your own custom folders. You can drag and drop models from the library browser to the viewport to add them to your scene. You can also double-click on a model in the library browser to open it in a new window. You can also use the search box to filter models by name or category.

These are the basic features of SpeedTree Modeler 5.1 that you need to know to get started with creating realistic 3D environments.
