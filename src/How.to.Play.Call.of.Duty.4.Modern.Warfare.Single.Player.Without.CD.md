A no-CD crack is a modified version of the game executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without inserting the disc. There are different versions of no-CD cracks for different patches of the game, so you need to make sure you download the one that matches your game version. You can find out your game version by looking at the bottom right corner of the main menu screen.
 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the no-CD crack from one of these sources: [^1^], [^2^], [^3^], or [^4^]. Make sure you choose the right version for your game patch.
2. Extract the downloaded file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Copy the extracted file (usually named iw3sp.exe) and paste it into your game installation folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare.
4. Replace the original file when prompted.
5. Run the game as usual and enjoy the single player mode without CD.

Note: Using a no-CD crack may violate the terms of service of the game and may cause some issues with online multiplayer mode. Use it at your own risk and discretion.

If you want to play online multiplayer mode without CD, you will need a different solution. A no-CD crack will not work for online mode, as the game servers will detect it and prevent you from joining. Instead, you will need to use a program called Steam, which is a digital distribution platform that allows you to buy, download, and play games online.
 
Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Steam from [https://store.steampowered.com/](https://store.steampowered.com/).
2. Create a free account or log in with your existing one.
3. Go to the Store tab and search for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.
4. Buy the game and add it to your library. You can also look for discounts or sales to get it cheaper.
5. Download and install the game through Steam. You will not need a CD to play it.
6. Launch the game from Steam and enjoy the online multiplayer mode.

Note: Using Steam may require you to create a new profile and start over your progress in the game. You may also need to update your game to the latest version to play online. Steam also has its own terms of service and privacy policy that you should read and agree to before using it.

Steam is not only a way to play Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare online without CD, but also a platform that offers many other benefits for gamers. Here are some of them:
